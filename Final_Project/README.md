# Understanding Income Classification

## About this Project

Our goal is to create different predictive models for income classification based off our feature set. We implement several different types of models and analyze our models to determine which model is the best predictor of income classification. Additionally, we use a binary classifier of income greater than $50000 and income less than $50000.

## Data & Dependencies

We pull out data from the 1994 Census. Additionally, we use a number of different R libraries for our analysis.

## Technical Approach

We create three different model types including K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine. Upon conclusion of our testing and training, we created confusion matrices and analyzed misclassification rate so that we could see which of our three models performed best.

## Highlights

* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* EDA
* K-nearest neighbor
* Random forest
* Support Vector Machine
* Data analysis

## Conclusion

From our analysis, we have deduced that the svm method has given us the lowest misclassification rate, therefore it is our primary choice as the best method.
